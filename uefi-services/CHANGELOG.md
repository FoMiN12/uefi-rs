# uefi-services - [Unreleased]

# uefi-services - 0.17.0 (2023-03-19)

## Changed
- Drop use of unstable `alloc_error_handler` feature. As of Rust 1.68 we can use
  [`default_alloc_error_handler`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/102318)
  instead.


# uefi-services - 0.16.0 (2023-01-16)

# uefi-services - 0.15.0 (2022-11-15)

## Changed
- Changed the panic handler log message to use `println!` instead of
  `error!`. This removes an extraneous file name and line number from
  the log message.
- Added a `logger` feature which reflects the same feature in `uefi`.
  This allows using both crates while disabling `logger` in `uefi`,
  which was previously impossible.


# uefi-services - 0.14.0 (2022-09-09)

## Added
- Added `print!` and `println!` macros.

## Changed

  `panic_handler` feature. The new feature is enabled by default.

## Changed

  earlier patch versions.
